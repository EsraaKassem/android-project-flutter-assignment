Question 1 : The snappingSheetController Widget Class is used to implement the controller pattern in
 the library,it controls the sheet in multiple ways like controlling snap positions of the snapping
 sheet, it has snapPositions property which can hold the snap positions of the sheet and it also has
 a snapToPosition method which can change the snap position.
 It can also extract information from the sheet like currentPosition, currentlySnapping and isAttached.

Question 2: The SnappingSheet class has a snapPositions Property which is a list that holds the
different snapping positions for the SheetBelow.

Question 3: InkWell and GestureDetector do more or less the same thing (provide the same features)
except that GestureDetector is more broad and can provide more complex options,The InkWell is a child
of the material widget. The advantage of GestureDetector over InkWell is that it provides more gestures
and controls like dragging,and that its does not need to have a Material ancestor.
on the other hand InkWell is a rectangle area of Material that responds to ink splashes,so it has
effects such as ripple effect tap and other ink related features that arent found in gesture.
In other words GestureDetector provides more controls like dragging etc. on the other hand it doesn't include ripple
effect tap, which InkWell does."# android-project-flutter-assignment"
